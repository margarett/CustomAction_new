This is a rewrite of the original [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=331[Custom Action[/url] MOD by [url=http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=12859]winrules[/url]/[url=http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=211029]Norv[/url], designed to run in [b]SMF 2.1[/b]

With the Custom Action Mod you can create custom pages that are wrapped in your forum's theme. 
[b]Features[/b]
With this MOD you:
- have the option to use sub-actions
- select which membergroups can access the actions
- choose whether to show a menu button
In this new version, you can also choose (via permissions) which membergroups are allowed to create, edit and remove Actions. Each action/page can be written with BBC and HTML/PHP (in these cases, admin only)

The MOD is now hook-aholic so there are no file edits, which means it should work with any theme.
